real-time querying of Big Data

5. What are the different modes in which Hbase can be run?

Answer:
Standalone
Distributed

6. Why is zookeeper needed in Hbase?
Answer:
A distributed HBase relies completely on Zookeeper for cluster configuration and management. 
In Apache HBase, ZooKeeper coordinates, communicates, and shares state between the Masters and RegionServers.
